signature tool for work

[index.html](https://lzjzhuanyong.github.io) back to the basic index page

~~index.html~~ [signingTool.html](https://lzjzhuanyong.github.io/signingTool.html) uses [forge.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) as the module to sign the query string by using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm. 

~~[wstool.html](https://lzjzhuanyong.github.io/wstool.html) uses [pako.js](https://github.com/nodeca/pako) as the module to decompress the gzip data.~~

[wstool.html](https://lzjzhuanyong.github.io/wstool.html) no longer uses "pako.js" to do decompression

2022-10-14 update: new page style of the wstool

2022-10-20 update: datalist of input label for url quick choosing, and add new optional functions for more composability

2023-01-06 update: Add a new page for the RSA key generation tool.  This page is fully designed with friendly style. 

(I was manually added the web worker script for the RSA generation, not used the forge.js imbedded web worker function, because I want to learn and familiar with this feature.)
